## üîê Security Setup (IMPORTANT)

**Before running this application, you must set up your environment variables:**

1. **Copy the environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   ```

2. **Configure your AWS credentials in `server/.env`:**
   ```bash
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_actual_aws_access_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_actual_aws_secret_key
   S3_BUCKET_NAME=your_s3_bucket_name
   ```

3. **Configure AWS Cognito in `server/.env`:**
   ```bash
   COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your_user_pool_id
   ```

4. **Optional: Enable AI features:**
   ```bash
   TEXTRACT_ENABLED=true
   BEDROCK_ENABLED=true
   BEDROCK_MODEL=anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0
   ```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Never commit the `server/.env` file to Git. It contains sensitive credentials.**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
