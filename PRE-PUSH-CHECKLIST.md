# Pre-Push Checklist for Law AI Backend

## ‚úÖ Security Status
- [x] Environment variables properly configured in `server/.env`
- [x] `server/.env` is git-ignored (confirmed with `git check-ignore`)
- [x] No secrets hardcoded in source files
- [x] IAM policy document created (`iam-policy.json`)
- [x] Setup guide created (`AWS-SETUP-GUIDE.md`)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  AWS Configuration Status
- [x] **Environment Variables**: All required variables set
- [ ] **IAM Permissions**: Need to apply `iam-policy.json` to user `JosephEsfandiari`  
- [ ] **S3 Bucket**: Verify `contractfiles1` exists in `us-east-1`
- [ ] **Permissions Test**: Start server with `node index.js` (should start successfully after IAM setup)

## üöÄ Safe to Push Status

**Current Status: SAFE TO PUSH** ‚úÖ

**Why it's safe:**
1. All secrets are in `.env` file (git-ignored)
2. Source code contains no sensitive data
3. IAM policy is documented but not applied yet
4. App will work once you apply the IAM permissions

**What happens after push:**
1. Other developers will need to:
   - Copy `server/.env.example` to `server/.env`
   - Add their own AWS credentials
   - Apply the IAM policy to their users
2. The application is ready for deployment once IAM is configured

## üìã Action Items After Push

1. **Apply IAM Policy** (in AWS Console):
   ```
   User: JosephEsfandiari
   Policy: Use JSON from server/iam-policy.json
   ```

2. **Verify S3 Bucket**:
   - Check bucket `contractfiles1` exists
   - Ensure it's in `us-east-1` region

3. **Test Configuration**:
   ```bash
   cd server
   node index.js
   ```

4. **Enable AI Features** (optional later):
   ```bash
   # In server/.env
   TEXTRACT_ENABLED=true
   BEDROCK_ENABLED=true
   ```

## üéØ Ready to Push!

Your code is secure and ready for GitHub. The AWS configuration can be completed after pushing using the provided setup guide and IAM policy.
